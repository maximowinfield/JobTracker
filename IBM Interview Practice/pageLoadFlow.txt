Job Apps Page Load Flow (with Files)

User navigates to Job Apps page
→ JobAppsPage.tsx

React runs an effect on mount to load data
→ JobAppsPage.tsx (useEffect)

Page calls the Job Apps service layer
→ jobapps.ts

Service calls the shared API client
→ client.ts

API client attaches Authorization header (JWT)
→ client.ts

Request enters backend middleware pipeline
→ Program.cs                                                                                                                    

JWT is validated
→ Program.cs (UseAuthentication())

Authorization rules are enforced
→ Program.cs (UseAuthorization())

Request is routed to the Job Apps endpoints
→ JobAppEndpoints.cs

Endpoint reads/writes data using EF Core
→ AppDbContext (via JobApplication.cs, ApplicationStatus.cs)

API returns JSON response
→ JobAppEndpoints.cs

Frontend receives data and updates state
→ JobAppsPage.tsx

UI renders the job application list
→ JobAppsPage.tsx

// Job Apps Page Load Flow (High-Level)
// 1. User navigates to the Job Apps page and JobAppsPage.tsx mounts
// 2. A useEffect runs on mount to load job application data
// 3. The effect calls the service layer in jobApps.ts
// 4. The service uses the shared API client in client.ts
// 5. The API client automatically attaches the Authorization header with the JWT
// 6. The request enters the backend through Program.cs
//    - UseAuthentication validates the JWT
//    - UseAuthorization enforces access rules
// 7. The request is routed to JobAppEndpoints.cs
// 8. Endpoints use Entity Framework Core via AppDbContext
//    to read or write JobApplication data
// 9. The API returns a JSON response
// 10. The frontend updates state and renders the job application list
