## How did you decide on your tech stack for your projects?

Tech Stack:
See Tech_Stack_Overview.pdf

1. I chose my tech stack based on realism and scalability. For both projects, I used .NET 8 Minimal APIs on the backend because I wanted a clean, production-style API with strong typing, built-in dependency injection, and first-class support for authentication. I looked for the most support and easiest methods, these projects were meant to be worked on and scaled throughout the year.

2. Larger Explanation:
   For my both projects, I intentionally chose a modern full-stack setup that reflects how production apps are built.
   On the backend, .NET 8 Minimal APIs let me keep a clean HTTP surface while still supporting middleware like JWT authentication, authorization policies, and async data access.
   I used EF Core because it gives me strong domain modeling, relationship handling, and provider abstraction—so the same queries work across SQLite and PostgreSQL.
   On the frontend, React gave me predictable state flow and reusable components, which was especially important for things like Kanban boards, attachments, and role-based UI.
   The stack wasn’t random—it was chosen to demonstrate real-world patterns, not just to make something that ‘works.

## Why IBM?

1. IBM, often referred to as “Big Blue,” stands out to me because it has been a technology leader for over a century, tracing back to its founding in 1911. Very few companies have remained relevant across so many eras of computing, and that longevity reflects IBM’s strong engineering culture and long-term vision.

What really attracts me to IBM is the focus on enterprise-scale systems. There is a clear respect for building technology that lasts, meaning systems that are secure, reliable, and maintainable over time. That mindset aligns closely with how I approach my own projects.

I am also excited about IBM’s leadership in AI and cloud platforms, especially at the enterprise level. More recently, IBM partnered with Etisalat, now known as e& (pronounced E-and), to collaborate on enterprise-grade agentic AI solutions. That partnership shows how IBM applies AI in real business environments with governance and trust built in.

Finally, the IBM watsonx platform really stands out to me. I like that watsonx is structured around three core parts.
watsonx.ai is where AI models live and run.
watsonx.data supports AI workloads through trusted enterprise data.
watsonx.governance allows tracking of model behavior, risk, and compliance.

What I find especially compelling about agentic AI is that it does not just respond to prompts. It has the ability to take action and complete multi-step tasks, while still operating within clear, governed boundaries. Having the opportunity to work with watsonx and contribute to that kind of system would be a huge honor.

## Quick one-liners:

1. You guys have been doing it for well over a hundred years
2. I'm aware of the recent partnering with e& (etisalat) to collaborate on an enterprise-grade agentic AI solution
   (I would love to be a part of that ^)
3. Agentic AI
4. If there was an opportunity to use Watsonx is a huge honor. I know about the three core parts of WatsonX, there is watsonx.ai, watsonx.data, and watsonx.governance

.ai is where AI models live and run
while .data supports the AI workloads
.governance allows tracking of model behavior amongst other things.

5. What I like about Agentic AI is that it doesn't just respond it has the ability to take action. Even multi-step tasks.

## More Quick one-liners

1. IBM has been building enterprise technology for over a hundred years, and that longevity matters to me.

2. I am aware of IBM’s recent partnership with Etisalat, now e&, on enterprise-grade agentic AI solutions.

3. What excites me about agentic AI is that it can take action, not just respond, including multi-step workflows.

4. watsonx stands out because it treats AI as a complete system, including models, data, and governance.

## What’s your favorite frontend library?

1. My favorite frontend library is React. I like React because it encourages component-based design, predictable data flow, and clean separation of concerns in the UI.

In my projects, React makes it much easier to manage complex user interfaces, such as Kanban-style workflows, drag-and-drop interactions, and role-based views, without the codebase becoming difficult to maintain. The way React handles state and composition allows the UI to scale as features grow.

I also appreciate that React is flexible rather than overly opinionated. It gives me control over architecture decisions, which mirrors how backend systems are designed, instead of locking me into a rigid framework.
