# Problem:
# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring
# without repeating characters.
#
# Example:
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3  # "abc"

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    best = 0

    for right, ch in enumerate(s):
        while ch in seen:
            # we're removing the left most character string so that the window can move right by +1
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        # if we haven't seen the character, we're adding it to the seen set
        seen.add(ch)

        best = max(best, right - left + 1)

    return best


# Pattern: Sliding Window + Set
#
# Interview explanation:
# I use a sliding window to represent a substring with unique characters.
# The right pointer expands the window using enumerate, starting at index 0.
# I use a set to track which characters are currently in the window.
# If a duplicate character appears, I shrink the window from the left
# until the window becomes valid again.
# After each valid window, I update the maximum length found so far.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
