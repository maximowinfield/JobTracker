# Problem:
# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list
# and return the new head.
#
# Example:
# Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
# Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

#define the reverseList function, we pass the head through it
def reverseList(head):
    # always start with prev as none, because the singly linked list is not a cycle
    prev = None
    # we start at the head as usual
    curr = head

    # start a while loop
    while curr:
        # we are setting the nxt node (saving it) because we are about to break the chain
        nxt = curr.next
        # this is important as we are setting the next node of the current to the previous node.
        curr.next = prev
        # now that my next node of my current is previous (reversed) we set the current node to previous.
        prev = curr
        # now that we set the previous node to the current one, the next pointer becomes the current node!
        curr = nxt
    # we return prev, because prev is now the new head of the reversed list
    return prev

# Pattern: Linked List Pointer Manipulation
#
# Interview explanation:
# I iterate through the linked list while reversing the direction of each node’s
# next pointer. I keep track of the previous node, the current node, and the next
# node so I do not lose access to the rest of the list.
# At each step, I redirect the current node’s next pointer to the previous node,
# then advance both pointers forward.
# When the traversal is complete, the previous node becomes the new head.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
