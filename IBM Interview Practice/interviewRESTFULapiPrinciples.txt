Meaningful HTTP Status Codes
Uniform Interface
Layered System
Cacheability


Client–Server Separation
The frontend and backend are decoupled, allowing each to evolve independently.

Statelessness
Each request contains all required information; the server does not store client session state.

Resource-Based Design
The API exposes resources (nouns) through unique URIs rather than actions.

Use of Standard HTTP Methods
HTTP verbs express intent (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).

Meaningful HTTP Status Codes
Responses clearly communicate success or failure (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404).

Uniform Interface
Consistent endpoint structure, request/response formats, and error handling.

Layered System Architecture
The client is abstracted from internal implementation details (services, data access, middleware).

Cacheability (Where Appropriate)
Responses define whether data can be cached to improve performance.
